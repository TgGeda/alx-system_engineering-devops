## Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "List of currently running processes:"

ps aux | awk '{print $2, $11}' | grep -v PID

# The awk command is used to print only the process ID (PID) and process name.
# The grep command is used to remove the header (PID COMMAND) from the output.
