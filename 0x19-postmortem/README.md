# Postmortem: Service Outage on Web Stack

## Issue Summary
Duration: 2 hours, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC + 3)
Impact: The web service was completely down, resulting in a 100% outage for all users.

## Timeline
- 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system sent an alert about the service being unresponsive.
- 10:05 AM: The operations team initiated an investigation into the issue, suspecting a potential server failure.
- 10:10 AM: The team noticed high CPU utilization on the server hosting the web service, leading them to believe it was the root cause.
- 10:15 AM: The server was rebooted to resolve the high CPU utilization issue, but the service remained unresponsive.
- 10:20 AM: Further investigation revealed no issues with the server hardware or network connectivity.
- 10:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the development team, as the issue seemed to be related to the application code.
- 10:45 AM: The development team analyzed the application logs and identified a memory leak as the root cause of the service outage.
- 11:00 AM: The team deployed a hotfix to address the memory leak issue and restarted the web service.
- 12:00 PM: The service was fully restored, and users could access it without any issues.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the service outage was a memory leak in the web application code. Over time, the application was consuming an excessive amount of memory, leading to high CPU utilization and eventually causing the service to crash. The memory leak was due to an inefficient data caching mechanism.

To fix the issue, the development team implemented a patch that optimized the data caching process, preventing memory leaks. Additionally, they added automated memory monitoring and alerting to detect any future memory-related issues promptly.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1. Conduct regular code reviews: Implement a mandatory code review process to identify potential memory leaks and other performance issues before deployment.
2. Implement automated testing: Enhance the existing test suite to include stress testing and memory profiling to catch memory leaks during the development phase.
3. Improve monitoring and alerting: Enhance the monitoring system to provide more granular insights into memory usage and set up alerts for abnormal memory behavior.
4. Implement automated deployments: Automate the deployment process to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of human error during deployments.
5. Conduct post-deployment testing: Perform thorough testing after each deployment to verify the stability and performance of the application.
6. Establish incident response protocols: Define clear escalation paths and communication channels to ensure swift resolution during future incidents.

## Tasks to Address the Issue
1. Patch the web application code to optimize the data caching mechanism.
2. Enhance the test suite to include stress testing and memory profiling.
3. Improve the monitoring system to provide detailed memory usage insights.
4. Automate the deployment process to reduce human error.
5. Perform post-deployment testing to verify stability and performance.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents, improve the overall stability of the web service, and provide a seamless user experience.
